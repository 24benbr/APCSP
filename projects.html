    <p class="p"> This was my Art One final last year, I had to make a website showing my art portfolio. I am really proud of how it trurned out, I think it looks really professional and shows my artistic skill. It had four pages, the home page, artwork, sketchbook, and blog. I had four blog posts detailing some of my favorite works throughout the semester. </p>

  <h1>I Search</h1>
  <img class = "image" src = "isearch.jpg">
  <p class="p"> This is the first page of y I Search, which was a research project last year. I wrote a twenty page paper on the topic of NBA players mental state. More specifically the ability to reach flow state, and dealing woth the anxiety and stresses that come with being a professional athlete. I interviewed my highschool basketball coach, as he played at the next level at UCONN. I also listened to an hour long interview with Kevin Love an dwrote about what he said. Love has been one of the most outspoken athletes about his mentak health. I really enjoyed this assignment and am proud of the work I did. </p>
